# Intro

This project was created with React and Redux. For UI part the React MUI library was used.
The main screen lists all the users and display's the total count of post per each user. It is possible to view individual post by clicking the user. 
The idea was to load all comments by clicking the button under each post. It is also possible to delete posts and create a new one.

# Potential improvements
 - UI and UX part could be improved by creating a propper form validation, addding visual icons in order to make the APP more intuitive for the end user.
 - Unit testing and Visual testing can be added in order to not brake the app when new changes comes.
 - Pagination could be added for easier navigation between the pages
